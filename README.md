TODO:

[ ] Show last month overview
    [ ] Should show month expenses and remaining money
    [ ] Item Grouping into categories
        [ ] Do some of the work automatic if possible
        [ ] Maybe have a dynamic interface that allows to set/modify categories to every item
    [ ] Then we can show statistics with graph libs
    [ ] Try to determinate wich ones are recurrent expenses like common services like internet/electricity.
